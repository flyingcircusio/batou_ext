## 2.4.19 (2024-11-28)


- make the DeploymentTrash's trash directory configurable and output a potentially helpful message on OSErrors which could indicate that the trash directory and the directory that is being trashed are on different devices


## 2.4.18 (2024-11-15)


- nixos.NixOSModule: Mark generated context file as sensitive (Fixes #167)

- add an env argument for the `Run` component to support running commands with specific environment variables

- The component `batou_ext.python.FixELFRunPath` now uses a patched version of patchelf to make sure that the
  dynamic libraries don't get larger per deploy.

  When a certain threshold is exceeded, Python will fail to import these.

  If the component got regularly executed in deployments, you may want to consider recreating
  the virtualenv once.


## 2.4.17 (2024-10-28)


- A new component `batou_ext.systemd.ScalableService` has been added. This provides configurations
  for a service that can exist multiple times (e.g. queue consumers). Detailed usage instructions
  and further information can be found in the component's docstring.


## 2.4.16 (2024-09-11)


- A new component `batou_ext.mail.Mailpit` has been added.
  Mailpit is an alternative for Mailhog which is not maintained anymore.

- fix a mysterious regression that cause a test to fail

- redis.Redis: Allow to set provide name

* The `SymlinkAndCleanup` internally uses the `DeploymentTrash` component internally which
  deletes old code using `systemd-tmpfiles` and throttles the operation with `IOReadIOPSMax`
  and `IOWriteIOPSMax`.

  This didn't have any effect before because these settings were wrongly placed in `[Unit]`
  instead of `[Service]`.


## 2.4.15 (2024-08-26)


- fix a regression in the versions update script where the environment was not loaded correctly


## 2.4.14 (2024-08-12)


- `ssl.Certificate`: Set proper ACL for non-let's encrypt certificates.


## 2.4.13 (2024-08-12)


- Fix setting acl for `ssl.Certificate` during ceritificate renewal.


## 2.4.12 (2024-08-12)


- Set correct acl for `ssl.Certificates` on certificate renew.


## 2.4.11 (2024-08-09)


- `oci.Container`: Add option to disable OCI container monitoring.

  This is mainly useful for containers which are not running all the time.

- `oci.Container`: make rebuild optional

  This is useful, when there are multiple container deployed which should be activated at once.

- Fix a bug in the version update script where multiple environments sharing the same branch would not be updated correctly

- the `SymlinkAndCleanup` component was adjusted to clean up asynchronously using systemd's tmpfiles instead of deleting all candidates immediately


## 2.4.10 (2024-06-11)


- oci.Container: Fix a bug where containers were not restarted properly even though their image digest was out of sync after the remote tag has been updated

- oci.Container: Fix a typo in the oci container component's verify method


## 2.4.9 (2024-06-04)


- `batou_ext.python.FixELFRunPath`: search not only `env_directory`, but also its subdirs for C libraries needed by the libraries to patch.

- Fix `PurgePackage` raising error when package is not found.

- The attribute `public_smtp_name` of `batou_ext.mail.Mailhog` now has a default value. It points to `self.host.fqdn`.

- adjust the certificate expiry check output to be more easily parseable


## 2.4.8 (2024-05-08)


- systemd timers: add an option to enable persistence
  breaking change: systemd timers are now non-persistent by default.
  The previous default behaviour was a problem for cronjobs that should
  not be started immediately following a reboot / downtime

* Added a component `batou_ext.python.FixELFRunPath` which modifies `DT_RUNPATH` & `DT_RPATH` of `.so`-files in a venv to load the correct libraries (from either a Nix env or other Python libraries). Please read the docstring carefully before using it.

- OCI: cache validation result during deployment.

  Caching results speeds up deployments where multiple containers with the same image are deployed.


## 2.4.7 (2024-04-29)


* Added component `batou_ext.http.HTTPServiceWatchdog` that adds a check to a systemd unit
  whether a given URL is reachable (e.g. a `/health` endpoint). If the URL cannot be reached within
  a certain interval, the service will be restarted. Further details are documented in the
  docstring.

- Fix `SymlinkAndCleanup` async delete and allow custom extra arguments to `systemd run`.


## 2.4.6 (2024-04-23)


- OCI: Support registries where the docker login is different than the registry used in referencing containers.

- OCI: Improve change detection of remote images (required for docker.io)

- OCI: The nix file does not contain sensitive data, so donâ€™t mark it as such.

- OCI: add support for extraOptions

* Added a script `s3_bootstrap` that interactively creates an S3 bucket (including a radosgw account & keys if needed). Will be installed with `batou_ext` if the `s3-bootstrap` extra is requested.


## 2.4.5 (2024-04-17)


- add an option to move mailhog log output (`stdout` + `stderr`) to a different namespace, e.g. "mailhog". see systemd.exec(5) for more information

- add an option to disable `stdout` logging for the mailhog service

- improve dectection of a versions file for versions updates

- fix the oci.Container verify method not throwing an updaterequired on changes to the docker container's environment file

- Add systemd-run async cleanup option for SymlinkAndCleanup removals


## 2.4.4 (2024-04-05)


- Change the behaviour of the batou_ext.versions updater to allow environments to share a branch

* Added a component `batou_ext.git.Remote` which allows to manipulate remotes of a git repository.


## 2.4.3 (2024-01-17)


- Improve output handling for the `PurgePackage` component. Will not appear like a fatal error in logs anymore when the package has been purged already or is not installed for another reason


## 2.4.2 (2023-12-08)


* Make it possible to add arbitrary additional configuration to a service created by a `SystemdTimer()`.

* Add `nixos.NixOSModule` to inject component attributes into .nix files.


## 2.4.1 (2023-11-16)


* Add `*.md` to the release, so it can actually be used.


## 2.4.0 (2023-11-16)

- Add release process with changelog (FC-33250).
