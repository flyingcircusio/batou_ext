- `batou_ext.oci.Container`: allow to use `podman` as backend instead of `docker`.
  This also enables the following features:

  * Rootless containers: by setting the `user` option to a different user. By default,
    the service user of the deployment is used.

  * Only mark services as `active` if the container is up. This requires that the
    container has a healthcheck. Alternatively, a healthcheck can be configured
    with the health_cmd attribute.
