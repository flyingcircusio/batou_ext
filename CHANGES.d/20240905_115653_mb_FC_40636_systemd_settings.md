* The `SymlinkAndCleanup` internally uses the `DeploymentTrash` component internally which
  deletes old code using `systemd-tmpfiles` and throttles the operation with `IOReadIOPSMax`
  and `IOWriteIOPSMax`.

  This didn't have any effect before because these settings were wrongly placed in `[Unit]`
  instead of `[Service]`.
