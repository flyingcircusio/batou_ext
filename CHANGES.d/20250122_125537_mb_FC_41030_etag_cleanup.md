- `batou_ext.file.SymlinkAndCleanup`: add option `etag_suffix`.
  This contains a suffix that each symlinked file may have.

  For instance, when doing `SymlinkAndCleanup` on a file downloaded with
  `batou_ext.s3.Download`, the pattern `*.tar.gz` doesn't clean up the
  `.etag` files. However, `*.tar.gz*` (or an equivalent) would also remove
  the etag files of the files that are symlinked to `current` & `last`.
