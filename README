batou_ext - a library of components for batou
=============================================

To add ``batou_ext`` to your deployment, add a like to the ``requirements.txt`` of your batou deployment::

    hg+https://bitbucket.org/flyingcircus/batou_ext@ea0073d08bda#egg=batou_ext

Note that there needs to be a fixed revision (e.g. ``ea0073d08bda``). This has two reasons:

1. You *really* want the deployment to be repeatable. If you just use ``tip`` you never know what you'll get.

2. Updating is not stable. If you don't specify a revision, any is fine. You will end up with different revisions on different hosts.
